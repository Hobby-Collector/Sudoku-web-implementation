# <b>Sudoku</b> <br>a Web Based Implementaion

## Overview


<b>Sudoku</b> (originally called "Number Place") is a logic-based, combinatorial, number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

For a fun project I decided I need to turn something very relaxing and time consuming into something stressful and time consuming (see: this project). So I've written the wonderful game of Sudoku into a website.

<p>The game is designed to load looking as such</p>

<p>Once a difficulty button on the side has been pressed a puzzle will load </p>

<p>Then finally the solved board should cause a message to display</p>

## Technologies
<p>For this project I used primarily HTML5, CSS, and Javascript<br>I also used the fantastic tool https://qqwing.com written by Stephen Osteromiller ostermiller.org to generate a number of boards while working on creating a generate function in my code</p>


## Getting Started
<p>you'll first want to find your way on over to https://hobby-collector.github.io/Sudoku-web-implementation Then choose your difficulty and start playing! once a puzzle loads in just fill each remaining square with the numbers 1-9 until each region,line and column has exactly one of each number (1-9 that is) </p>

### Congratulations You've Won!

# What's Next!

Still a lot of work left to do on this project. 
<br>- In some spare time I'd like to add:<br>

    ☐ Puzzle Generation beyond having a few hardcoded puzzles of each difficulty.

	☐ Note taking, akin to the functionality of most Sudoku apps out there

	☐ correct and incorrect highlighting once the board is filled out.

	☐ make website mobile friendly
